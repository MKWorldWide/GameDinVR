## üöÄ Quick Start
1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/M-K-World-Wide/GameDinVR.git
   ```
2. **Open in Unity 2022 LTS**
3. **Import VRChat SDK3 (Worlds) via [VCC](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/)**
4. **Import UdonSharp:**
   - Double-click `Assets/SDKPackages/UdonSharp.unitypackage` in Unity
5. **Auto-build the scene:**
   - In Unity, go to `GameDinVR > Build Citadel Scene`
   - This creates the complete scene with all components
6. **Build & test in VRChat!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Automated Build & Deployment (Vision)
- **Goal:** One-command build from Cursor ‚Üí Unity ‚Üí VRChat
- **Scripts planned:**
  - Download/update SDKs & UdonSharp
  - Auto-import UnityPackages
  - Scene layout automation
  - VRChat world upload (via CLI/API if available)
- **API Needs:**
  - VRChat does not currently offer a public world-upload API; automation is limited to local build/import steps.
  - If/when VRChat exposes a CLI or API for world upload, we will integrate it here.
