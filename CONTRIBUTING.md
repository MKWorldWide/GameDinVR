## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull Request** so we can review your changes

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2022.3.6f1 (LTS)
- VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)
- Node.js 20.x (for Serafina development)
- Git

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Unity Development

1. Open the project in Unity Hub
2. Use VCC to import required SDKs:
   - VRChat Worlds SDK 3.6.0+
   - UdonSharp 1.1.0+
3. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message

### Serafina (Discord Bot) Development

1. Navigate to the `serafina` directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Update `.env` with your configuration
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîÄ Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
